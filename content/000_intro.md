# Welcome to 50 drops of PHP

## The reason why
This book collects 50 useful, unknown, underrated PHP functions or stuff discovered, used, learned during the PHP daily use.

Using frameworks daily, sometimes the perception of the power of the language and of the basic functionalities provided by the PHP core could be lost. I see that usually I used to look at the framework documentation or look for a package in Packagist for system, array, string functions instead using core functionalities provided by the language.

While I wrote this book, I also wrote some scripts to better understand the behaviour of the functions. You can find these examples here: https://github.com/roberto-butti/50-drops-of-php in *examples* directory.

### Continuous release

I was thinking to print this book, but I think that is not so eco-friendly and a book about development could be improved daily in terms of spellchecking and in the content and examples. So, my expectation is adopting the same approach in the software with the CI/CD, with a continuous release of the book.

Releases:
- (current) release 1.0.2 (23 November 2021): "Fix license and fonts";
- release 1.0.1 (14 November 2021): "Fix typos, grammar, and clarification edits".
